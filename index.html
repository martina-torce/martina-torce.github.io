<br>
I am currently an Undergraduate Student at Imperial College London, pursuing an MEng in Molecular Bioengineering.

I am interested in various topics relating to Technology like Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, Data Analytics and Blockchain. Additionally, I am interested in how these topics can be applied to the Financial industry, as I have a personal interest with the Financial Markets. In university, I have expressed my interest in these topics through active participation in the committees for societies such as the Investment, Blockchain and Consultancy Society.

Please feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn following the link on the left, and to contact me by email or LinkedIn messages.
