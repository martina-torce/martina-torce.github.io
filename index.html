I am an Undergraduate Student at Imperial College London, pursuing an MEng in
Molecular Bioengineering with a Computational approach.
<br /><br />
I am interested in various topics relating to Technology like Artificial
Intelligence, Data Science, Data Analytics and Blockchain. Additionally, I am
interested in how these topics can be applied to the Financial industry.
<br /><br />
In university, I have expressed my interest in these topics through active
participation in the committees for societies such as the Investment, Blockchain
and Consultancy Society.
<br /><br />
Additionally, I have secured a Spring Internship in Technology with Optiver and
a Summer Internship in Machine Learning Research with the Institute of Cancer
Research.
<br /><br />
Please feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn, and to contact me by email or
through LinkedIn messages. I am open to networking and collaborating on projects
remotely.
