The trading strategy developed uses the Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) index and its correlation with crude oil prices to inform trading decisions. During periods of high EPU volatility, the strategy suggests selling crude oil and buying it back in 180 days, whereas in periods of low EPU volatility, it recommends buying crude oil and selling it after 180 days.
